```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This serves more as a reminder for myself.
But in case anyone is interested:
This is a simple Shiny Dashboard.
If you just want to run it locally without using Docker you can 
clone the repo and just run the shiny app via

```{r eval=FALSE}
shiny::runApp("app/")
```

You may also run it inside a Docker container:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# In case of permission issues 
# sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
docker build -t maxxxy-shinydashboard-image .
docker run -d --rm -p 8080:8080 maxxxy-shinydashboard-image
```

Go to http://localhost:8080 and have fun. ðŸ”¥
